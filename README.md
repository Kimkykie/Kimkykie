### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack software developer who enjoys research and development. I have experience with JavaScript, ReactJS, Redux, NodeJS, Python, and MongoDB.

I also love playing with data. I am a fulltime data scraper :sunglasses: with Puppeteer. I have experience data cleaning and analysis with Pandas and currently working on deep learning with fast.ai.

The lords of blogging spoke to me and I answered here https://dev.to/kimkiragu
